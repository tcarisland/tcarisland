Hi, my name's Thor Arisland, I'm a software developer who enjoys working with vectors, pixel-art and music production.

This page serves as my blog, while my static site is available on [tcarisland.no](https://site.tcarisland.no).

On this page I'll share news, tutorials and updates while I'm working on my main site.
